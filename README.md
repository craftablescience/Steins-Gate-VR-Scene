# Steins;Gate VR Scene
A recreation of the Steins;Gate lab in VR. (please don't sue me ;-;)

## IMPORTANT:
The actual lab .blend is not in this GitHub repo, because it is ~185MB, almost double the max file size. You will have to create a `Blend` folder inside the `Assets` folder, and then paste "steins;gate.blend" into this folder from this link:

After that, using Unity 2019.3 the project will work.
